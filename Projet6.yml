## This script is made for automatize the deployment of EC2 instances on AWS.
## Before running the script you must :
## Had dowload and set the app awscli.
## In your local hosts file add the line :
## [
## [local]
## localhost ansible_connection=local ansible_python_interpreter=python3 
## ]
## Untag the single tagged line bellow and modify it with your own configuration.

---
  - name: Create EC2 instance
    hosts: local
    connection: local
    gather_facts: False
    tags: provisioning
## required parameters :
    vars:
#      instance_type: t2.micro
#      security_group: Admin
#      image: ami-095********
#      keypair: awsp6
#      region: eu-west-3
#      count: 2
## Instance type : Is the model of the instance will be used by amazon for the deployment. 
## Security group : Is the name of the group you made when you had configured AWS CLI. 
## Image : "ami" file provided by amazon that work like .iso image.
## Keypair : It's the SSH file you will use to acces the instance, you can genereta one on AWS website.
## region : eu-west-3, for Paris, it's where your VM will be host.
## count : It's the number of instances you will deploy with this configuration.

## Task that will be used to Launch/Create an EC2 Instance. There is basic firewall rules, you can add somes bellow.
## Imcomming trafic are open to SSH, HTTP and HTTPS
## Outcoming Allow all

## Creating the new Instances by using the vars set before.

#        register: ec2_awsp6
 
      - name: Add the newly created EC2 instance(s) to the local host group
## Set the log file you will use for saving the list of the machines you had deployed, it will add the IP address  :
        local_action: lineinfile 
#                      path=/mypath/to/logfile.txt
                      regexp={{ item.public_ip }}

        add_host:
          hostname: "{{ item.public_ip }}"
          groupname: launched
#        with_items: "{{ ec2_awsp6.instances }}"
 
 ## We connect to the instance by SSH using the public IP we get at the creation of the instance. 
      - name: Let's wait for SSH to come up. Usually that takes ~10 seconds
        local_action: wait_for 
                      host={{ item.public_ip }}

                      state=started
 #       with_items: '{{ ec2_awsp6.instances }}'
 ## You can change Instance's tag after" Name:"
 ## It will be the information displayed on AWS website that will help you identify the newly created instance.
      - name: Add tag to Instance(s)
        local_action: ec2_tag resource={{ item.id }} region={{ region }} state=present
#        with_items: '{{ ec2_awsp6.instances }}'
